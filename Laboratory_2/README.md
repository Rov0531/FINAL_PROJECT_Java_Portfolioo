In this activity, I created a basic book catalog system using Java. I started by defining a Book class so I could easily store details like the title, author, and the year it was published. For each book, I also added a 'current page' property that starts at zero by default. Inside the main method, I instantiated five different book objects with their respective details. I then practiced how to manipulate the data—specifically, I used a changePage method to update how far I've read in some books and used a setter to fix the author's name for the Java Programming book. Finally, I grouped all these objects into an array so I could loop through them. I added a simple if-statement inside that loop to filter the list and only print the titles of the books that were published after the year 2010. It’s basically a demonstration of how to create objects, update their values, and filter through a collection of data.
