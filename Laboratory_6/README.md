This Smart Home Control System uses Abstraction and Polymorphism to manage different household appliances under one unified structure. I created an Abstract Class called Device which acts as a parent for all gadgets like the AC, Lamp, TV, and Microwave; this class handles the basic stuff like turning the power on or off and tracking the device location. Each specific device then "extends" this class and provides its own version of the status() method—for example, the AC shows temperature while the TV shows the channel. In the main program, I used an ArrayList to group all these different devices together, allowing me to use a single loop to turn everything on or off at once and count how many are currently running. It’s a clean way to handle multiple unique objects using shared logic.
