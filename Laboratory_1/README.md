This program is a simple Library Management System built using Java. It basically uses a Book class to store the title and the current status of each book. I used an array to hold the data and a switch-case inside a loop so the user can keep choosing options from the menu—like adding a book, changing its status from available to borrowed, or viewing the whole list. There’s also a report feature that automatically counts and summarizes how many books are currently in the system and their status. Overall, it’s a basic way to handle book records and keep track of inventory in one go.
