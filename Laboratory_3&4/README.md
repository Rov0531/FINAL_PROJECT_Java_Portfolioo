This program is a Customer Loyalty System that uses the Customer class to track names, points, and a running total of registered users through a static variable. It features two constructors—one for specific details and a default one for "Unknown" guests—and uses methods like addPoints and redeemReward to simulate real-world shop transactions. Throughout the code, points are added for purchases and subtracted when a customer "buys" a drink using 100 points, while the displayCustomerInfo method prints a summary of everyone's status. Essentially, it demonstrates how Object-Oriented Programming can manage a shop's database by creating individual customer objects and updating their shared and private data.
