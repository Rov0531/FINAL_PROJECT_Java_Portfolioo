This program shows how Inheritance and Composition work in Java by organizing a school system with people, students, teachers, and courses. I created a base class called Person to hold common info like name and age, then used the extends keyword so that Student and Teacher can inherit those traits while adding their own specific details, like Student IDs or Departments. I also used Composition by giving the Teacher an array of Course objects, which connects the teachers to the specific subjects they handle. In the main method, I initialized these objects, stored them in arrays, and called different display methods to print out a clean breakdown of everyone’s basic info, student records, and teacher-course assignments.
