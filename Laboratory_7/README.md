This program is a GUI-based To-Do List app that uses Java Swing to create a visual interface. It works by using Inheritance: I have an AbstractTask parent class that sets the rules, and a Task class that handles the actual data like the name and description.The code is split into two main parts: the Logic and the Interface. The TaskManager class acts as the brain, storing all tasks in a list. The TaskListViewer is the main window with a table, and the TaskForm is the pop-up window where you type in new tasks. When you save a task, it’s added to the list and the table refreshes automatically to show the new entry.
